# CatClicker - README WORK IN PROGRESS
**CatClicker** is a simple game where you -the player- gain love points for your cat through either random loot, or by manually clicking on the cat. Not unlike [Cookie Clicker ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_Clicker) in certain aspects. 

**Table of Contents**
* [App Concept](https://github.com/s028214/CatClicker/blob/main/README.md#app-concept) - Concept, explanation and gameplay
* Developement - Code documentation
* System Requirement - Needed hardware/software
* Quick Start - xCode and iOS deployment 


## App Concept
Gain as many points as possible for Filipe (or whatever you call the lil car), the Cat! 
Run down of frontend UI + game explanation.

*Note: "love" points can also be described as ❤️ point

**Points counter -** <br>
Similarly to cookie clicker, you are able to gain or lose ❤️: # <br>
In the app, it'll be displayed in terms of a percentage on the top of your device. <br>

Each 10 "love" points is calcualted as 1%.
